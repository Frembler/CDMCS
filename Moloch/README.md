This material has been designed to be taught in a [classroom](https://ccdcoe.org/cyber-defence-monitoring-course-suite-module-3-0.html) environment... hands-on 90% talk 10% **slides 0%**

**The material is missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.**

This is **0.5 + 3 + 0.5 days** of material for any intermediate-level dev-ops who has some experience with other security|monitoring tools and wants to learn Moloch. We believe these classes are perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Moloch or who wants a more thorough understanding of it internals.
