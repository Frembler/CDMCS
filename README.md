# Cyber Defence Monitoring Course Suite (CDMCS)

This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment.

The material is missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.

This is 3 x ( .5 + 3 + .5 ) days of material for any intermediate-level dev-ops who has some experience with other security|monitoring tools and wants to learn IDS, PCAP or event processing technologies. We believe these classes are perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning these or who wants a more thorough understanding their internals.
