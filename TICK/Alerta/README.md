# Alerta

> The alerta monitoring system is a tool used to consolidate and de-duplicate alerts from multiple sources for quick ‘at-a-glance’ visualisation. Alerta combines a **JSON API server** for receiving, processing and rendering alerts with a simple, yet effective Alerta **Web UI** and **command-line tool**.
